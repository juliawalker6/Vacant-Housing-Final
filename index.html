	<h1>Syracuse's Vacant Housing</h1>
	<h2> Julia Walker
<p>Tucked behind an oak tree on Onondaga Ave. is a tan and olive green house listed for 1,000 dollars. Its front porch steps bend under the weight of growing moss. Inside, a crystal chandelier hangs from a ceiling with peeling paint, and metropolitan style bathroom tile lines the bathroom floor. Gaps in the walls reveal the inner wooden skeleton of the house. On an upper floor, oak tree branches bend in through open windows and wrap around inside walls.</p>



<p>The low listing price might be shocking. However, 1,000 dollars is just the tip of the iceberg. Syracuse History – a social media account which films tours of vacant houses throughout the city, estimates the home will cost around 500 thousand dollars in structural repairs and renovations.</p>



<p>Around 2,000 homes in Syracuse sit vacant, even as homelessness rates in the city increase. As vacant houses “disintegrate” with time, residents worry about lead exposure health risks and the maintenance of the history of Syracuse’s buildings. However, the city is attempting to buy these vacant properties and find new owners for the homes, according to Open Data Syracuse.</p>

<p>Many of the vacant homes can also become a “breeding ground for nuisance and crime,” which can decrease the value of surrounding homes in neighborhoods, according to the city of Syracuse’s website. To occupy these vacant homes would be to increase the overall value of the city, according to the website.</p>
	

<p>“We have two major housing problems here in Syracuse,” said the city’s Housing Authority Executive Director Bill Simmons. “Firstly, we don’t have enough housing. The second problem is our housing stock is very old.”</p>



<p>Old housing stock is a cause for concern when it comes to vacant housing leading to lead exposure health issues, Simmons said. Lead paint was the primary paint used for houses until it was banned from use in 1978. Around three quarters of Syracuse’s housing was built before lead paint was banned, according to the United States 2022 census.</p>



<p>When lead paint is unmaintained, it is more likely to chip or turn into lead dust – meaning that Syracuse’s vacant houses painted with lead paint are less likely to be maintained and more likely to pose a health risk for those living in close proximity. For children, lead exposure can cause symptoms as minor as headaches and symptoms as extreme as cognitive damage and stunted growth, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>



<p>To help residents with fees for removing lead from their homes – which can cost upwards of 18,000 dollars – Syracuse is considering a proposed housing fund which will also create new housing, improve old housing conditions, and buy vacant properties from absentee landlords, said Simmons. The fund’s proposal sparked when a 2023 Syracuse Housing Study found that one-third of the city’s housing was in visible decline, said Simmons.</p>


<p>Simmons, who manages the city’s affordable public housing, also discussed plans to tear down and replace old public housing buildings, which leaves 6 percent of the public housing units currently vacant. He clarified that some cities leave affordable housing units vacant because they cannot afford to renovate them for safety reasons, but this is not the case for Syracuse’s affordable housing vacancies.</p>



<p>“Our vacancies right now are intentional,” Simmons said. “It’s to make room for our upcoming renovations to create even more housing for more families than we can house right now.”</p>



<p>Building new affordable housing and occupying current vacant housing should be two top priorities, said Simmons, especially because the homelessness rate in Central New York has increased by 40 percent this year, according to The Homeless and Housing Coalition.</p>



<p>“We have a situation in this country,” Simmons said of managing the national housing crisis. “It’s a tough job, but we do think we have a good plan by increasing our housing.”</p>

<p>To remedy the non-public housing vacancies, Syracuse began The Greater Syracuse Land Bank to “address the problems of vacant and abandoned housing” and “return that property to productive use in order to strengthen the economy, improve the quality of life, and improve the financial condition” of Syracuse,” according to the organization’s website.</p>

<p>The land bank has acquired over 2,000 vacant properties since its start in 2012 and has sold over 1,000 of them, according to its website. Although the listings are priced low, buyers must have proof of enough funds to renovate the property they are interested in buying, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The website is a patchwork of property pictures – some old churches, some victorian-style houses covered in ivy, and many with boarded up windows.</p>


<p>One listed land bank property – the 1,000 dollar house on Onondaga Ave. – still sits vacant with its moss-covered steps and diamond chandelier on the inside. But at the rate the land bank has been selling properties, it might not be vacant for long.</p>
